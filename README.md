Contains report for white dwarf project undertaken in Naxxatra Equinox 2020

This project was undertaken during the very first Naxxatra Equinox program in 2020. We investigated white dwarf stars, deriving the Chandrashekar limit, and numerically simulating the mass-radius relationship between white dwarf stars containing carbon and iron. The code is available in the report. Written in python.
